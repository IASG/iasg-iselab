On Tuesday, Februrary 09 Meeting, Jake Drahos presented on Reverse Engineering Web APIs:

  This talk provided some background and an introduction to reverse engineer a private web API used by a mobile application. Many applications rely on an API, which is not exposed to the user. What happens when we start talking directly to this API?

Following the presentation, there was a Lab Jam in Coover 1012 where you can go hands-on with these topics, and/or play with the IASG virtual environment.

This is the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DVsHj7bnhm67njFSga6rexSw9beC49_VWzbcSPyLqHc/edit?usp=sharing) of the meeting.

Additionally, this Saturday is the National Cyber Defense Competition at Iowa State. For the first time ever, the CDC is augmented with a Cyber-Physical aspect, addressing security concerns with SCADA in addition to the web. ISEAGE is looking for Green Team volunteers to help out at the competition. You can sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ATftRcIRt7rQW_EFwc0sPnTZhsRp6q3k2Iqb6O0x9F8/viewform). 

If you are going, good luck at the career fair tomorrow!
