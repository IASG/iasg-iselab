Wireshark
-------------------
This Tuesday is our third meeting of the semester, and we'll have Cabinet Secretary Megan Miller presenting on Wireshark, a popular network sniffer and packet analyzer. Wireshark is 
useful for learning about how networks and protocols operate, and can also be used for advanced tasks such as malware analysis, protocol development/debugging, and reverse engineering.

Beginner's Night
--
After the main presentation, Cabinet Equipment Chair Kole Swesey will be hosting the next installment in our Beginner's Night series: "Introduction to Networking". This talk will
highlight the different layers of modern networks and how networks can be configured. Part of the talk will cover Linux Networking, as a continuation from (last week's Beginner's Night)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSkU6wvXhKQ].
A lot of this information will be helpful in understanding how to better utilize Wireshark.
