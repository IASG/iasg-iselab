<h2 id="nsa-codebreaker-challenge">NSA Codebreaker Challenge</h2>
<p>The NSA Codebreaker Challenge is a series of realistic challenges relating to reverse
engineering and low-level vulnerability exploitation. There are six challenges
in total, each increasing in difficulty.</p>

<p>While everyone who participates will get a slightly different set of files,
collaboration is encouraged and participants may help each other out.</p>

<p>It would be great to get Iowa State up on the leaderboard this year! Make sure to
register this Friday, September 15th! The club will likely have meet-ups to work on this event together.</p>
