<p>Today at IASG, there was a presentation on Network Security. This presentation was over networking and the TCP/IP at a high level, and discussing the implications of security at each level. Networking is one of the foundational pillars of security, thus a general understanding of networking greatly helps with other security concepts.</p>

<p>Following the meeting, we had a brief demonstration of using Wireshark, the network protocol analyzer.</p>
