<p>Similar to the Information Assurance classes, IASG has been provided with access to a virtualized environment for club members to play around in. Attacks can be conducted
within this environment without worrying about affecting the real world.</p>

<p>You can access the environment through our VPN, SSH hop, or web shell and web browser.</p>
