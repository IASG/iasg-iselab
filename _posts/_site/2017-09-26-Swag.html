<p>Attention IASG! Important announcement!</p>
<h2 id="iasg-is-getting-swag-1"><strong>IASG is getting SWAG!</strong></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, Iâ€™m not much of a graphic designer, so I need your help. Make a design, and send it to <a href="mailto:woolery@iastate.edu">woolery@iastate.edu</a>. In two weeks, the submissions will be put to a vote, and if your design is selected, get a copy of it for <em>FREE.</em> To view previous submissions, go <a href="www.bit.ly/IASGSWAG">here</a>. Feel free to redesign an existing idea, or come up with your own. We are primarily looking for T-shirts and stickers, but if something else is popular, we might make it happen. Good Luck!</p>
