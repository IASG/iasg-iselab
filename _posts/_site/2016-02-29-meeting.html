<p>Yesterday, we were back with another exciting presentation. Matt Brown gave a talk on scripting web attacks.
He discussed how to prototype web attacks using nothing but a web browser and scripting these attacking using Python. He offered everyone a chance during the presentation and later at beginner’s night to try scripting these attacks against his demos and against OWASP’s Mutillidae.</p>

<p>Following the presentation, there was a Beginner’s night on the presentation material, where everyone had the opportunity to try these things out. This started around 6-6:15 in Coover 1012.</p>
