Reverse Engineering
---
Logan Kinneer will give a talk on reverse engineering x86_64 executable files
on Linux. We'll start with an overview of the ELF file structure, then move
into how to read assembly code, and end by talking about a few obfuscation
techniques and how they can be circumvented.

"Hack the Box"
---
Following the talk we will be having a "Hack The Box" night where we will use
ISELab to attack a [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com) box together. Please
bring your laptop if you would like to participate! People with all ranges of
security knowledge (beginner to expert) will be able to join in on the fun.
