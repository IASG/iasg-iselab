Cryptography
---
At 5:15PM in Coover 3043 on Tuesday, Alex Scheel is coming in to talk about
cryptography. He plans on making his session interactive and wants you all to
ask as many questions as possible!

> Solving systems of boolean equations is one of the NP-Complete problems in
Computer Science. Traditionally thought intractable, the past 20 years of SAT
solving competitions has resulted in the development of many fast solvers which
have seen adoption by industry. Starting in the early 2000s, the field of
logical cryptanalysis was developed by F. Massacci and detailed the application
of SAT solvers to cryptanalysis. However, much of the early work until 2010
used cryptography to generate benchmarks for SAT solvers instead of using them
for cryptanalysis. In this talk, we present new techniques for
horizontally-scalable logical cryptanalysis of hash functions. These techniques
allows us to study the structure inherent to the function and easily probe them
for weaknesses, giving implications for real-world applications.

Beginner's Night
---
Following the crypto talk, we have the first Beginner's Night of the semester.
The beginner's night will be presented by social chair Kevin Davis, and it will
cover an introduction to networking. Networking is a core skill that is useful
for any security professional or enthusiast, and we hope to help you get
started learning.
