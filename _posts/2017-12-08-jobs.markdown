Hi all,

Park, and just posted a position. The link is below.
* Timing: We will interview applicants in January after the break, and have
  them start working in February. If any students have questions or concerns
  about the positions, I’d be glad to provide my email address so they can
  reach me – [mcclurgjamesc@johndeere.com](mailto:mcclurgjamesc@johndeere.com).
  Since this is all new, we want to hear any questions or feedback.
* Work schedule: We will work around students’ schedules for the work hours
  during the school year as well as during breaks.
