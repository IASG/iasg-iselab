NSA Codebreaker Challenge
-------------------
The NSA Codebreaker Challenge is a series of realistic challenges relating to reverse
engineering and low-level vulnerability exploitation. There are six challenges
in total, each increasing in difficulty.

While everyone who participates will get a slightly different set of files,
collaboration is encouraged and participants may help each other out.

It would be great to get Iowa State up on the leaderboard this year! Make sure to
register this Friday, September 15th! The club will likely have meet-ups to work on this event together.
