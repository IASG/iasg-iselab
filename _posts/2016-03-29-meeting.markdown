Information sent over wireless devices
-------------------
Tonight's presentation discussed the information your wireless devices are send out over the air. The presentation focused on how this data can be used for legitimate and nefarious purposes to track locations of users, and how this can be prevented. We discussed tools that can be used to collect this information and how it can be visualized.



There will be no activity following tonight's meeting.
