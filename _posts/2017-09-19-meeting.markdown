Guest Speaker
-------------------
This Tuesday is the second meeting of the semester, and we're inviting a guest speaker - Dave Nelson, CEO of Integrity - to speak. Here's a description of Dave and his talk:

"Dave Nelson is a cybersecurity entrepreneur whose company, Integrity, is the leading pure-play information security firm in Iowa.  
Their consulting and managed services divisions serve clients across the US. Dave will be discussing the vast career field opportunities in Iowa ranging from 
technical roles such as penetration testing, secure coding, and digital forensics to more business focused roles such at IT risk management, security control design, and 
testing or security research. Dave is a Fellow with the Information Systems Security Association and founded the Iowa ISSA chapter along with the widely popular Secure
Iowa Conference held in Ankeny every October. As a well-known expert in the field, Dave has his pulse on current and future career opportunities and will answer questions 
about what to expect in the cybersecurity career field."

Beginner's Night

After our guest speaker, Keane O'Kelley will be hosting the first beginner's night of the semester: "Hacking 101: Introduction to the Linux Operating System". If you're new to Linux, 
or are competing in the CDC, you'll want to stick around for it!
